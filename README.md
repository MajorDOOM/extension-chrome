# Restore Google Maps on Search

This extension provides a simple and effective solution for those who have noticed the disappearance of the Maps button in Google search results.

This change stems from European legislation aimed at limiting the promotion of Google's own products within the European Union, in order to maintain fair competition among various services. As a result, the direct and convenient access to maps and routes from the search page was lost for many users.

With Restore Google Maps, we offer a straightforward way to bring this key functionality back. 

Technically, this extension changes the search region to being in Switzerland (a country therefore outside the European Union), but this has no impact on your searches since Google still detects your real location with the information of your internet connection.

Once this extension is installed, the Maps button reappears in your Google search results, allowing you to access Maps with just one click. Whether you're planning your daily commute or exploring new destinations, this extension makes navigation faster and more convenient, without any complications or detours.
